title: Matt G. Wagner - What I Use
---

# Favorites

I like reading about how other people use technology and applications in their day-to-day lives, similar to [The Setup - What do people use to get stuff done?](http://usesthis.com) in which people explain their hardware and software setups. I've done a mini version of this for myself below.

**Who are you, and what do you do?**  
I'm Matt Wagner, a Software Developer working out of my home office in Lakeland, FL. I've worked in software for about five years, spreading my time between .NET and Java shops. My alter ego is as an Officer Candidate attending OCS for the Florida Army National Guard.

**What hardware are you using?**  
My home office has two pretty solid development machines running Windows 8.1 Professional. My desktop is a quad-core AMD Phenom II with 16GB of RAM and a 128 GB SSD. Once you get an SSD, you'll never go back. The desktop powers two 23" monitors. The desktop sites side-by-side with a laptop dedicated to work (Intel Core i7, 8GB of RAM, hybrid SSD HDD) powering an external 23" monitor. Both of these machines are controlled via one keyboard and mouse a la Synergy (software KVM).

I have a Microsoft Comfort Curve keyboard at both home and the office. I couldn't stand the original wireless iMac keyboard, so the Comfort Curve was a great, small expense. I'm not picky about mice, but I was struggling to get used to the Magic Mouse and went back to a general Dell OEM mouse.
I receive e-mail on my beat up HTC Incredible, which is badly in need of replacement due to a badly cracked screen.

My wife and I watch tv and movies streaming over our X-Box 360 Media Center in the living room and a [Roku](http://roku.com) box stashed away in the bedroom. 

**And what software?** 
I do most of my development in Visual Studio 2012, at both work and at home. I've kind of become entrenched into the VS experience, and C# is my most fluent language. I use it for a few pet projects kicking around, probably deployed to AppHarbor.

I'm a fan of Notepad++ to do any text editing and occasional HTML/Markdown coding, like building this website. I do the majority of my browsing in the dev channel of Google Chrome. Some extensions that are necessities are [LastPass](http://lastpass.com), [Xmarks](http://xmarks.com), Google Voice, and Evernote.

I use [LastPass](http://lastpass.com) to sync my passwords across browsers and computers, and it's sister company, Xmarks, to do the same for bookmarks. Evernote is my repository of choice for URL's, notes, designs, and basically anything I want to remember at a later date.

I use [Google Voice](http://google.com/voice) for the majority of my text messaging and to route my incoming calls. I've been a user since the GrandCentral days.

I'm a [Pandora](http://pandora.com) junkie, as I have it on every computer, TV, and phone. I even use it occasionally on my Kindle Fire. That's usually one thing always running both at work and at home. Occasionally in the car in between, too.

I'm in love with my [Kindle Fire](http://amazon.com). I have gotten through 15 or so books in the 3-4 months I've owned it, and it's also great to sync articles with another love, [Instapaper](http://instapaper.com). All of the articles I come across on Google Reader get synched into Instapaper for later reading on the Kindle.

I version my code using Git and [GitHub](http://github.com/mattgwagner). 

I remember everything on my to do and grocery lists with [Remember the Milk](http://rememberthemilk.com), synced to my phone.

[Mint](http://mint.com) helps me track all of my finances and budgetting.

**What would be your dream setup?** 
I'm really a pretty simple guy. I don't really take full advantage of my current hardware setup. I think the main thing to improve would a dedicated, stand-alone server with a ton of storage and low-power usage.
