# About Me

<img src="/images/Honeymoon.JPG" />

I am a 26 year old software developer from Tampa, FL. I grew up in Lakeland, FL before moving to attend the University of South Florida in Tampa. I am married to my best friend, Amanda, and we share a home with our pit bull mix, Demi.

## Career

I took my first job at the University of South Florida working at the Academic Computing Help Desk, helping to provide technical support to both students and facutly of one of the country's largest universities. It was a great learning experience for me, as I was able to hone my communication skills as well as get some valuable job training for later positions. I worked there part-time while attending classes before moving on to another position with USF in the University Controller's Office. At the UCO, I worked as the main technical asset in charge of deploying and maintaining about 150 end-user desktop and laptop machines and other hardware.

I left there to take an internship at JPMorganChase as part of the Corporate Development Program in the summer of 2008, working as a Web Applications Developer. Our team's main product was Treasury Services flagship electronic statement platform which serviced thousands of large cap organizations, generating and retrieving their account analysis and demand deposit account statements. At Chase, I worked as a project and technical lead on several projects in charge of project management, planning, and organization with development resources in Mumbai, India.

After working at Chase, I was recruited and joined a speciality software development company in Clearwater, FL, called Loop. The flagship product, AutoLoop, was a best-of-class automated marketing and customer retention software suite that helped auto dealerships keep their customers coming back. I was a developer on their infrastructure and integrations team, reporting to the CTO, and helping to keep the backend administration and data imports rolling.

In the fall of 2010, I joined the Florida Army National Guard and attended Basic Combat Training at Fort Sill, OK. Upon my return from BCT, my wife and I moved back to my hometown to settle in. After spending some time working for a local credit union, I returned to working for Loop as a remote developer from my home office. I left to join a partner company, ASRPro, to work on their integration and architecture.

## Hobbies

In my free time, which seems to be less and less these days, I can probably be found reading somewhere around the house on my Kindle Fire. A gift from my wife for our one year wedding anniversary, I've plowed through more books in a shorter period of time by far then in physical books. I tend to carry it with me everywhere.

In the past, I've played quite a bit of disc golf with some of my friends at the local courses. We've also, at various times, participated in both kickball and softball leagues. Last season, I pitched in the Tampa wood bat baseball league, all of which kept me in pretty good shape. I spent a season coaching Little League baseball for 9-10 year olds, which was very satisfying and I hope to get back into one day.

Lately, my wife and I have taken up CrossFit. The constantly varied workouts and practical exercises are great for anyone in law enforcement or the military, as we both are. I would heartily recommend everyone give it a shot, even though it's definitely not for everyone.
