# Projects

Here is some information on some current and former projects I've worked on.

## This Website

This project is rendered from it's markdown source files via Nesta, a ruby project to transform markdown or HAML into rendered HTML. Since my site was mostly (all?) static, I could easily code in any text editor, push to BitBucket, and have the result sent to my hosting account. I'm still working on porting content over from some old versions, but I'm pretty happy with the ease of writing in markdown as opposed to HTML. I'm also flirting with HAML and SASS for the site design, in case anything looks weird.

## Project Euler

I'm slowly working through the [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net) problems in C#, Ruby, and Python, usually through brute force. The math behind some of the problems is pretty daunting, but the problems gave me a good excuse to try out some new languages and styles of coding. I eventually want to complete more of the problems, in new languages, and probably try and even pick up the math behind the process along the way.

## BitBucket

As a thorugh Mercurial fan, I have selected to host most of my projects and samples on BitBucket's hosting platform at [www.Code.MattgGWagner.com](http://code.mattgwagner.com). It has the source code to all of the aforementioned projects, and hopefully many more as I continue my random progression through pet projects.

## Deprecated

This is the graveyard of some of the awkward projects that I did in the past to learn new languages or scratch a particular itch.

### SharpSSH

The SharpSSH library was written as an open source project by Tamir Gal over at [Code Project](http://www.codeproject.com/KB/IP/sharpssh.aspx). The library was moved over to SourceForge but essentially abandoned sometime in 2007. The code was a direct port of JSCH from Java, with many of the Java system libraries still being referenced and many coding practices from .NET 1.1. I have rolled in some patches offered by users on SourceForge into an updated library and started cleaning up the code where I'm qualified to, updating the code with work with .NET 3.5/4.

I posted the updates I made to my BitBucket account and have actually gotten a few downloads of the updated version, along with issue reports. There are many more updated that remain, but I don't know if it'll gather any steam as there is a newer, viable open source competitor in [SSH.net](http://sshnet.codeplex.com/) on CodePlex.

### Disc Golf Tracker

One of my many outdoor activities for a long time was to play disc golf with some of my friends. As we started to get more competitive, we began keeping track of our scores and handicaps across many rounds, and comparing our progress to one another. Thus, the Disc Golf Tracker was born, built in Python and using the Django framework and SQLLite database. Although I don't get to play much anymore, this is something I would love to pick back up at a later point to add features to.

### Line-up Maker (Kickball)

As captain of an adult kickball team on week nights, one of the many duties was to arrange the line-up for the night. One of the most tedious and error-prone parts of the line up making was the need to keep a certain number of girls and guys on the field at all times while alternating players into and out of the game. This was my initial stab at putting together an application that takes in players names and genders and outputs a randomized line-up that meets certain given criteria.
